# Football Match Analysis using YOLO (Computer Vision)

## 📚 Overview

This project uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system, to analyze football matches. The goal is to track players, the ball, and key events in the game.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **YOLO** for object detection.
- **OpenCV** for video processing.
- **Python** for implementation.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## 📝 Future Improvements

- Add event detection (e.g., goals, fouls).
- Enhance player tracking accuracy.
- Compute players stats
